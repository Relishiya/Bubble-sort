# Bubble-sort
Bubble sorting using java. Bubble sorting works by comparing and swapping the values in the adjacent side. so it should be implemented one after the other.it should have a continuous process and the execution of the bubble sorting cannot be parallelized.the values which are lesser than the adjacent values are swapped to the left side. Like wise the iteration will move on until all the values have been sorted.
